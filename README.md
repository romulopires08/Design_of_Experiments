# DoE Statistical Tools

This Python library offers a comprehensive set of tools for the design of experiments (DoE). It is based on the works of Prof. Edenir Pereira Filho and B.Sc. André Luiz Machado Simão de Souza.
Features

Currently, the library includes the following functionalities:

    Screening of Significant Effects: Identify the most influential factors in your experiments.
    ANOVA Table: Generate an ANOVA table to analyze the differences among group means.
    Regression Analysis: Perform regression analysis to model the relationship between variables.
    Response Surface Methodology (RSM): Create response surface models to explore the relationships between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables.

New Features

    Experimental Evaluation without Central Points: Capability to evaluate experiments that do not include central points.
    Interactive Surface Modeling: Use matplotlib and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for interactive surface modeling, allowing for dynamic visualization and exploration of the response surfaces.
